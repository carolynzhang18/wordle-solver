# WordleSolver

For my Higher Level Mathematics (Analysis & Approaches) Internal Assessment (IB), I decided to investigate various Wordle (https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle/index.html) strategies and ultimately find the optimal Wordle solving algorithm. This GitHub repository will include a few different attempts at creating a Wordle solver, with each aiming to be a better version than the previous one. My Math IA, which will contain the collected data and analysis of each strategy, will also be included.

The final product, FINAL_WordleSolver.cpp, is a C++ file that is intended to help a user win any game of Wordle. Try it out!
